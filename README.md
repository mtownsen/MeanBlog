## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:

## Testing the Application
You can run the full test suite with the test task:

```bash
$ npm test
```
This will run both the server-side tests (located in the `app/tests/` directory) and the client-side tests (located in the `public/modules/*/tests/`).

To execute only the server tests, run the test:server task:

```bash
$ npm run test:server
```

To execute only the server tests and run again only changed tests, run the test:server:watch task:

```bash
$ npm run test:server:watch
```

And to run only the client tests, run the test:client task:

```bash
$ npm run test:client
```

## Running the application with Gulp
To start the development environment:

```bash
$ gulp
```

To run the application with *production* environment configuration, execute gulp as follows:

```bash
$ gulp prod
```
